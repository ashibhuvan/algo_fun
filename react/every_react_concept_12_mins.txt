1. Components:

Components are the building block of every react app. They allow you to make all the visible parts parts of an app such as
buttons, inputs, and entire pages.

You can use components as many times as you want. Every react component is a javascript function that returns markup.

function CoolFunction() {
	return <button>Click Me</button>
}
React components don't return HTML markup. They return JSX. Unlike HTML which is static and unchanging, you can use dynamic values in JSX. You can use curly braces for this.

2. Curly Braces let you insert dynamic data. 

const plant = 'world'
<div> Hello {planet} </div> Dynamic Attributes and Styling elements with Javascript objects.

3. React Fragment:

Javascript functions only let you return one parent element so you cant return multiple JSX tabs. You can use an empty <> which is a fragment.
<>
	<Header />
	<Main />
</>

4. Props:

If you want to pass data into another component you can use props. To make a prop create a name on the component you want to pass value to.
<Greeting text={'sample text'} />
You can then use that prop value

function Greeting(props) {
	return <h1>{props.text}</h1>
}

Props refers to properties on an object. Every object/prop has attributes.
You can achieve composition through props and children components.

5. Children:

<Parent>
<Child/>
</Parent>

function Parent(props) {
	return <div>{props.children}</div>
}

6. Keys Props
Used so react can tell one component apart from another. A key is a unique string or identifier. 

Rendering:
React uses the virtual dom for rendering. DOM is Document Object Model used to model the html elements on a website.

Rendering Steps:
1. If state of react app changes, react updates the virtual dom. This is quicker to update than real dom.
2. React then uses diffing on the dom and previous dom
3. Reconciliation -> apply the changes needed


Event Handling
Handles user interactions and events that occur.

<button onClick={handleClick} />
<input onChange={handleChange} />
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
